![Glove and our award](gloveandaward.png)

## Description

A musical glove that plays different notes based on which finger you combine with your thumb. The aluminium foil on the tip of each finger detects when a connection (or circuit) is created. Coded in arduino, the user can determine what instrument and which four notes to play.
